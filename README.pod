=head1 NAME

Pod::Weaver::Section::SeeAlso - add a SEE ALSO pod section

=head1 VERSION

  This document describes v1.003 of Pod::Weaver::Section::SeeAlso - released October 25, 2014 as part of Pod-Weaver-Section-SeeAlso.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This section plugin will produce a hunk of pod that references the main module of a dist
from its submodules, and adds any other text already present in the POD. It will do this
only if it is being built with L<Dist::Zilla>, because it needs the data from the dzil object.

In the main module, this section plugin just transforms the links into a proper list. In the
submodules, it also adds the link to the main module.

For an example of what the hunk looks like, look at the L</SEE ALSO> section in this POD :)

WARNING: Please do not put any POD commands in your SEE ALSO section!

What you should do when you want to add extra links is:

	=head1 SEE ALSO
	Foo::Bar
	Bar::Baz
	www.cpan.org

And this module will automatically convert it into:

	=head1 SEE ALSO
	=over 4
	=item *
	L<Main::Module>
	=item *
	L<Foo::Bar>
	=item *
	L<Bar::Baz>
	=item *
	L<www.cpan.org>
	=back

You can specify more links by using the "links" attribute, or by specifying it as a comment. The
format of the comment is:

	# SEEALSO: Foo::Bar, Module::Nice::Foo, www.foo.com

The way the links are ordered is: POD in the module, links attribute, comment links.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 add_main_link

A boolean value controlling whether the link back to the main module should be
added in the submodules.

Defaults to true.

=head2 header

Specify the content to be displayed before the list of links is shown.

The default is a sufficient explanation (see L</SEE ALSO>).

=head2 links

Specify a list of links you want to add to the SEE ALSO section.

You can either specify it like this: "Moose" or do it in POD format: "L<Moose>". This
module will automatically add the proper POD formatting if it is missing.

The default is an empty list.
